                <h1>Java: Write Once, Run Anywhere</h1>
                <p>Java is one of the most popular and versatile programming languages available as of 2020. It’s able to run anywhere without recompilation and is fairly easy to learn. Over 9 million developers public in Java, likely due to how many devices Java can run on.</p>
                <p>Java is another Object Oriented Programming language, and can be compared easily to C++ and Objective-C, Apple’s former programming language. While Java will always be popular and in demand, it’s different than most languages in that they don’t use classes, and instead use functions. Java also encourages test cases and agile programming, compared to other languages.</p>
