            <h1>C++: Technical and Powerful</h1>
            <p>C++ was created in 1985 as a version of C with Classes. As one of the original <abbr title="Object Oriented Programming">OOP</abbr>, C++ is mainly used for servers, applications, video games, and other technical services. The language is even used in space probes!</p>
            <p>C++ has influences most languages following it, including Swift and Java. Learning to program in C++ should be considered essential due to its versatility. The language more complex than Java and Swift, however having a base in C++ will vastly improve future ventures into programming.</p>
