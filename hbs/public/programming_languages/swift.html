                <h1>Swift: Apple's Definitive Language</h1>
                <p>Swift is the general-purpose language for all iOS, macOS, and watchOS devices provided by Apple. Created in 2014, Swift is a modern programming language most similar to other modern languages, like Python. Apple previously used Objective-C as their proprietary language for all devices, however Swift has replaced it.</p>
                <p>Swift is possibly the easiest language to program in. Appleâ€™s IDE, Xcode, is easy to learn and automatically generates code for connections to app elements. For first-timers, the language is friendly and easy to pick up. However, the language requires good syntax and proper spacing and tabs, similar to Python.</p>
