            <h1>Basic Overviews of Three Programming Languages</h1>
            <p> We're three common programming languages encountered all across the internet and beyond.</p>
            <p> Those languages are Java, C++, and Swift. These languages were chosen because they're</p>
            <p> fairly high-level languages that are easy to learn yet allow for significant amount of </p>
            <p> freedom in design and application. If you have a job in Compute Science, it's likely </p>
            <p> you'll have to use one of these languages.</p>
